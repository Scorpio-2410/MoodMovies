# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. Please download the project and open the client in VSC & server in VS 2022.
2. In VSC run the following command to install vite on your computer & apply changes to current project: npm install vite --save-dev or npm install.
3. Run the server, it will open Swagger API & on the client run: npm run dev which will display the frontend solution and communicate with backend solution that communicates with SQLite DB.

Note:
chmod +x /Users/nabidulislam/Desktop/App-Dev-Assignment-2/ReactApp/reactapp.client/node_modules/.bin/vite - For npm permissions issues
